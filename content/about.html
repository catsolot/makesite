<h1>About</h1>
<p>
Pulpways is a blog for anything and everything that I don't want directly
associated with my professional identity.
Mostly posts about arts and culture, but maybe some other things.
Perhaps random thoughts.

<h2>Why Pulpways?</h2>
<p>
The name Pulpways comes from a combination of wood pulp (and pulp magazines) and
<a href="https://folkways.si.edu/">Folkways</a>, the folk music record label.
I thought it sounded cool, which is what really matters.
